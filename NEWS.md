# imagine 2.0.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Important corrections, improvements and changes in engines 2, 4 and 5, so as in functions `convolutionQuantile`, `convolutionMedian`, `quantileFilter` and `contextualMF`.
* `times` argument in `contextualMF` is not longer available.
* `na` argument is removed from previous functions: only `NA` will be considered as a `NA`.
